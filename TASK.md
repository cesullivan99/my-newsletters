# My Newsletters Voice Assistant - Task Progress

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-10  
**Session:** Voice Assistant PRP Implementation  
**Command:** `/execute-prp PRPs/mynewsletters-voice-assistant.md` (this command was in the middle of running when we left off - continuation should keep the requirements of this command in mind).

## Context
This implementation is following the Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) located at `PRPs/mynewsletters-voice-assistant.md`. All remaining tasks should be completed according to the specifications and requirements defined in that PRP document.

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### Task 1: Project Setup

- ‚úÖ Create .env.example with all required environment variables

### Task 2: Database Models & Configuration  
- ‚úÖ Create backend/models/database.py with SQLAlchemy ORM models (User, Newsletter, Story, Session)
- ‚úÖ Create backend/config.py with Supabase connection and API key management

### Task 3: Gmail Integration Service
- ‚úÖ Create backend/services/gmail_service.py with OAuth 2.0 and email parsing
- ‚úÖ Create backend/services/newsletter_parser.py for HTML parsing and story extraction

### Task 4: Audio Processing Services
- ‚úÖ Create backend/services/audio_service.py with ElevenLabs streaming integration  
- ‚úÖ Create backend/services/storage_service.py for cloud audio file management

### Task 5: Background Audio Processing
- ‚úÖ Create backend/jobs/audio_processing.py for background TTS processing
- ‚úÖ Implemented audio processing job with ElevenLabs TTS integration
- ‚úÖ Added batch processing and error handling with database updates

### Task 6: Session Management
- ‚úÖ Create backend/services/session_manager.py for briefing session state
- ‚úÖ Implemented BriefingSessionManager with story progression tracking
- ‚úÖ Added session control methods (pause, resume, advance, metadata)

### Task 7: Vocode Voice Actions
- ‚úÖ Create Vocode actions (skip_story, tell_more, metadata) in backend/voice/actions/
- ‚úÖ Implemented BaseBriefingAction with shared session handling
- ‚úÖ Created SkipStoryAction, TellMeMoreAction, MetadataAction, ConversationalQueryAction
- ‚úÖ Added phrase-triggered action system with natural language commands

### Task 8: Vocode Integration
- ‚úÖ Create backend/voice/conversation_manager.py and agent_config.py
- ‚úÖ Implemented ConversationManager with Vocode StreamingConversation
- ‚úÖ Created BriefingActionFactory for custom action instantiation
- ‚úÖ Configured ChatGPT agent with phrase triggers and system prompts

### Task 9: API Layer
- ‚úÖ Create backend/main.py with Quart API routes and WebSocket endpoints
- ‚úÖ Implemented async REST API with briefing session management
- ‚úÖ Added WebSocket endpoint for real-time voice streaming
- ‚úÖ Created Pydantic schemas for request/response validation

## In Progress üöß

*Currently all backend core tasks completed - ready to proceed with frontend*

## Pending Tasks üìã

### Task 10: React Native Frontend  
- ‚è≥ Create React Native frontend with App.tsx and voice components

### Task 11: Authentication
- ‚è≥ Create authentication utilities and OAuth integration

### Task 12: Testing
- ‚è≥ Create comprehensive test suite for all components

## Final Validation üîç
- ‚è≥ Run validation loops and fix any failures
- ‚è≥ Verify all success criteria and checklist items

## Architecture Notes
- Using Vocode-only approach (no LangChain)
- ElevenLabs streaming TTS with optimize_streaming_latency
- Quart async web framework with native WebSocket support
- Supabase PostgreSQL database with asyncpg driver
- SQLAlchemy async ORM patterns with UUID primary keys
- Pydantic v2 models for API validation
- React Native with audio processing capabilities

## Current Status & Accomplishments üéØ

### Backend Core Complete ‚úÖ
The voice assistant backend is now fully implemented with:
- **Audio Processing**: Background TTS job with ElevenLabs streaming
- **Session Management**: Complete briefing state tracking and control
- **Voice Actions**: Real-time interruption handling with phrase triggers
- **Vocode Integration**: Full conversation management with STT/TTS
- **API Layer**: REST endpoints and WebSocket for voice streaming

### Key Features Implemented üöÄ
- Real-time voice interruptions ("skip", "tell me more", "what newsletter is this from?")
- Intelligent session state management with story progression
- Background audio pre-processing for smooth playback experience
- WebSocket-based voice communication with Vocode integration
- Comprehensive error handling and async operation throughout

### Next Steps for Completion
1. **Task 10**: React Native frontend with voice interface components
2. **Task 11**: Authentication utilities and OAuth Gmail integration
3. **Task 12**: Comprehensive testing suite for all components
4. **Final Validation**: Integration testing and PRP requirement verification

### Technical Architecture Highlights
- Fully async Python backend using Quart framework
- Vocode StreamingConversation with phrase-triggered actions
- SQLAlchemy async ORM with UUID primary keys
- ElevenLabs streaming TTS with latency optimization
- Pydantic v2 for robust API validation
