- ‚úÖ Created frontend/components/BriefingPlayer.tsx for audio briefing playback and controls

### Task 11: Authentication Integration
- ‚è≥ Complete OAuth endpoint implementation in backend for Gmail integration
- ‚è≥ Test authentication flow end-to-end

### Task 12: Testing
- ‚è≥ Create comprehensive test suite for all components

## Final Validation üîç
- ‚è≥ Run validation loops and fix any failures
- ‚è≥ Verify all success criteria and checklist items

## Architecture Notes
- Using Vocode-only approach (no LangChain)
- ElevenLabs streaming TTS with optimize_streaming_latency
- Quart async web framework with native WebSocket support
- Supabase PostgreSQL database with asyncpg driver
- SQLAlchemy async ORM patterns with UUID primary keys
- Pydantic v2 models for API validation
- React Native with audio processing capabilities
